# Code

- Source code for trivial dead code elimination passes: https://github.com/ethanuppal/cs6120/tree/main/lesson3/tdce
- Source code for local value numbering: https://github.com/ethanuppal/cs6120/tree/main/lesson3/lvn

I spent a few hours configuring CI for both of the above optimizations.
That serves as proof that my optimizations do work and that they work on **every
single benchmark file**. You can view the CI status here: https://github.com/ethanuppal/cs6120/actions/runs/13192590121/job/36828158528

## Trivial Dead Code Elimination

I implemented both dead code elimination passes shown in the video.

## Local Value Numbering
